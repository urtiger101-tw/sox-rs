//! wavicle — a pure-Rust WavPack v5 codec.
//!
//! A wavicle is Eddington's word for the quantum entity that is both wave and
//! particle. A lossless codec makes audio exactly that: a continuous wave to
//! the ear, discrete bits on disk, one identity in both observations.
//!
//! Scope: lossless mono/stereo decode and encode of the WavPack v5 stream —
//! 16/24/32-bit integer and bit-exact 32-bit float PCM. Pure Rust, no C,
//! wasm-capable. Out of scope: DSD, hybrid/lossy modes, correction files,
//! more than two channels, pre-4.0 legacy streams.
//!
//! **Status: round-trip codec, verified against the reference.** Both
//! directions, bit-exact and lossless: decode and encode of 16/24/32-bit
//! integer and 32-bit float, mono and stereo. Verified against the reference
//! `wvunpack`/`wavpack` over a corpus; float in both directions passes a
//! BLAKE3 round-trip identity check over the decoded f32 bytes. Decode is the
//! default build; [`encode_int`] and [`encode_float`] are behind the `encode`
//! feature and use a fixed multi-term decorrelation cascade (files land within
//! a hair of the reference encoder's size). Inputs of any length are supported:
//! the encoder splits long data into independent blocks. The founding plan and
//! conformance-oracle method live in the repository's `design_docs/`.
